# HTMS 💨 Stream Async HTML, Stay SEO-Friendly

> **"What if async content didn’t nuke your SEO?"**

> *(HTML streaming: ancient wisdom, modern awakening, progressive enhancement™.)*


HTMS is the absurdly simple answer to a dumbly persistent problem:
you want async content that shows up progressively, and you want search engines to actually see it.

**HTMS does both.** It streams HTML fragments as they’re ready, wraps them in tiny self-cleaning WebComponents, and
makes
sure the whole thing lands in the very first HTTP response. No hydration, no React-like ceremony, no SEO tax. Just async
HTML that behaves like… HTML.

## ⚡ The 30-Second Demo

HTMS is primarily about **streaming HTML**. The core idea? Bind HTML `data-htms` attributes to auto-generated async
methods that progressively replace content. Here's how it looks:

HTMS is on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/htms) because, of course, it is.

Write normal HTML with `data-htms` attributes:

```html
<header>Static content loads instantly</header>
<div data-htms="fn:breaking_news">Loading news...</div>
<div data-htms="fn:user_dashboard">Loading dashboard...</div>
<footer>Static content loads instantly</footer>
```

Write normal Rust async functions:

```rust
use htms::Template;

#[derive(Template)]
#[template = "page.html"]
pub struct HomePage;

// The `HomePageRender` trait is auto generated by the derive macro
impl HomePageRender for HomePage {
    async fn breaking_news_task() -> String {
        // Some API call - takes 2 seconds
        fetch_latest_news().await
    }

    async fn user_dashboard_task() -> String {
        // Heavy computation - takes 5 seconds
        generate_user_analytics().await
    }
}
```

Stream it all in one request with your favorite backend, here with [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) and our
adapter:

```rust
use htms::axum::HtmlStream;

async fn home_page_handler() -> Response {
    let stream = HomePage::default().render();

    HtmlStream::from(stream).into_response()
}
```

**Result:** Your page appears instantly with static content, then sections fill in progressively as async tasks
complete. All content is SEO-visible in the initial HTTP response.

```bash
cargo run -p demo --example dashboard
# Visit http://localhost:3000 and watch the magic
```

## 🧠 How It Actually Works

The “magic” isn’t magic at all — it’s just **one boring HTTP response, streamed in chunks**:

1. **Instant paint**: The browser gets real static HTML immediately, no waiting room.
2. **Async chunks**: Slow stuff (APIs, DB crunching, AI hallucinations…) arrives later, wrapped in `<htms-chunk>` tags
   inside the same stream.
3. **Self-cleaning swap**: Each `<htms-chunk>` runs a [microscopic](crates/core/src/static/htms_chunk.js) JS snippet
   that swaps the placeholder with the real thing, then yeets itself out of the DOM.
4. **SEO jackpot**: Because it’s all part of the original response body, search engines see the full page — async
   content included.

**No hydration. No virtual DOM.** Just HTML showing up as it’s ready, like the web has always pretended to work.

## 😉 The "Trust Me Bro" Comparison Chart

| Feature              | HTMS 💨                       | Traditional SPA         | SSR + Hydration               |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **First Paint**      | 🟢 Instant (real HTML)        | 🔴 Slow (JS boot)       | 🟢 Fast                       |
| **SEO**              | 🟢 Perfect (all in response)  | 🔴 Needs hacks          | 🟢 Good but complex           |
| **Progressive Load** | 🟢 Native streaming           | 🟢 Possible (XHR/fetch) | 🔴 Not really                 |
| **Complexity**       | 🟢 Low (HTML)                 | 🔴 High (framework tax) | 🔴 Very high (double work)    |
| **JS Required**      | 🟢 Minimal (self-cleaning WC) | 🔴 Heavy bundle         | 🔴 Heavy bundle               |
| **Developer Vibes**  | 🟢 “Wait, that’s it?”         | 🔴 “Where’s my state?”  | 🔴 “Why am I hydrating HTML?” |

## ⚠️ The Fine Print (AKA Reality Check)

**HTMS is experimental AF.** 🧪

This project started as "hold up, HTML streaming has been a thing since the late 90s, and nobody talks about it?! Time
to
experiment" and spiraled into a full-blown rabbit hole of Rust learning and web development philosophy. The starting
point of this journey was [this
article](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/streaming-html/) by Chris Coyier.

### 🎯 What This Really Is:

- A **learning playground** where I'm leveling up my Rust skills
- An **experiment** in making web development more enjoyable
- A **proof of concept** that streaming HTML doesn't have to suck
- Definitely **NOT production ready** (yet?)

### 🎢 What to Expect:

- **~~Rapid~~ iteration** - things might change dramatically between versions or not at all
- **Breaking changes** - semantic versioning is more like... semantic suggestions
- **Rough edges** - some features are held together with digital duct tape
- **Fun surprises** - new features might appear overnight (or disappear)

### 🤷 The Honest Truth:

I'm having way too much fun building this to promise anything stable. Use it, break it, contribute to it, but maybe
don't bet your startup on it just yet.

**But hey,** if you're as curious about the future of HTML streaming as I am, welcome aboard this beautiful mess! 🚀
